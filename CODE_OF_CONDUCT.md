# Group 7 Code of Conduct 

## Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
UBC students hail from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. To promote a safe and inclusive working environment, we pledge to making our project harassment-free regardless of age, race, gender, or religion. People who represent the project, either officially or unofficially, must follow the code of conduct.

## Expected Behaviour

**Examples of Acceptable Behaviour**
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing perspectives and experiences
* Being open and collaborative
* Accepting constructive criticism tactfully
* Ask for help when unsure

**Examples of Unacceptable Behaviour**
* Insulting, derogatory, and hateful language
* Harassment
* Trolling
* Publishing sensitive information without explicit permission 
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual
* Sexual language and imagery 
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience

Participants with an issued warning are expected to comply immediately.

## Consequences
If a participant breaches the code of conduct, a meeting will be arranged to discuss the problem with the participant. After investigating, warnings will be issued to the offender if necessary, and serious transgressions may lead to expulsion from the community.  

## Enforcement
Incidents may be reported directly to the DSCI 310 teaching team at <tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca>. 

## Attribution
