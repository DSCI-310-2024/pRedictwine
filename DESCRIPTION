Description: Contains 3 functions that are aimed to help in the workflow of a linear 
    regression analysis. Such functions are one to load an online dataset and change the 
    columns' names, another to create appropriate histograms, and a last one to directly 
    create the linear regression model. This package was created mainly for the prediction 
    of wine quality through MLR, found in 
    https://github.com/DSCI-310-2024/dsci-310_group-7_wine-quality-prediction.
